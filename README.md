## A Disrupted Industry

The pandemic was a very difficult time for the tourism industry. Tourist Prophet allows the user to access monthly historical data on the number of tourist visitors to a country and make a forecast using [Facebook’s Prophet](https://pypi.org/project/fbprophet/).

## Installation
### Libraries
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - An open-source [Python](https://www.python.org/) SQL toolkit which helps to convert data and interact between databases.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For data analysis and manipulation.

[Facebook’s Prophet](https://pypi.org/project/fbprophet/) - Enable forecasting including uncertainty levels.

[Questionary](https://pypi.org/project/questionary/) - Builds command line interface to interact and query the user.

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Creates static, animated or/and interactive visualizations.

### *Requirements*

The user needs to have Facebook's Prophet installed in their environment. They can get it by running this code:
```
>conda install plotly
>conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet
```

## Usage
Tourist Prophet is a Python app that needs to run on terminal. You will also need the SQL database called [tourism_data](https://github.com/TheoG2022/Team4_Project2/blob/main/Resources/tourism_data.db). 

The user can select one out of five countries:
[Iceland](https://www.ferdamalastofa.is/en/recearch-and-statistics/numbers-of-foreign-visitors), [Jamaica](https://tourismanalytics.com/jamaica.html), [Portugal](https://tradingeconomics.com/portugal/tourist-arrivals), [Singapore](https://stan.stb.gov.sg/public/sense/app/877a079c-e05f-4871-8d87-8e6cc1963b02/sheet/3df3802e-2e5b-4c79-950d-d7265c4c07a9/state/analysis), [UK](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ST.INT.RCPT.CD?locations=GB)

*The available historical data varies by country, the model in Tourist Prophet will use all available data.*

### Steps

1.  Select a country - The app will give you options from the list of countries in the SQL database
2.  Create a variable - The app will ask whether the user wants to create a dummy variable for the pandemic. The dummy will take the value of 1 if the month falls within the pandemic and 0 otherwise. If the user decides to create the variable it will then ask to specify the first and last month of the pandemic.
3.  Specify period to forecast - The user can specify the number of months they want to forecast. We think that about 50 months in the future is a fair forecast given available data, however, the user can enter any number. If the number is too large (~10,000) the program will not run. Typically, the forecast should be at most half the period on available data.
4.  The program will produce four graphs and save a file called 'forecast.csv' in the folder where the app is located.

The top graph shows the trend. The graph in the middle the annual seasonality. The bottom graph the coefficient of the dummy variable.
